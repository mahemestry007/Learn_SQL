Differences Between DROP and TRUNCATE
DROP	TRUNCATE
In the drop table data and its definition is deleted with their full structure.	It preserves the structure of the table for further use exist but deletes all the data.
Drop is used to eliminate existing complications and fewer complications in the whole database from the table.	Truncate is used to eliminate the tuples from the table.
Integrity constraints get removed in the DROP command.	Integrity constraint doesn’t get removed in the Truncate command.
 Since the structure does not exist, the View of the table does not exist in the Drop  command.	Since the structure exists, the View of the table exists in the Truncate command.
 Drop query frees the table space complications from memory.	This query does not free the table space from memory.
It is slow as there are so many complications compared to the TRUNCATE command.	It is fast as compared to the DROP command as there are fewer complications.


  1) DROP
  Syntax*

# To delete the whole Table
  DROP TABLE table_name; 

# To delete the whole database
 DROP DATABASE database_name; 



  -EXAMPLE-
  DROP TABLE EMPDATA;

  2) TRUNCATE
  Syntax*
  TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

  -EXAMPLE-
  TRUNCATE TABLE EMPDATA;

Conclusion:
Truncate is normally ultra-fast and it’s ideal for deleting data from a temporary table.
Truncate preserves the structure of the table for future use, unlike drop table where the table is deleted with its full structure.
Table or Database deletion using a DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so it must be used wisely.
