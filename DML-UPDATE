- SQL UPDATE -

In a very simple way, we can say that SQL commands(UPDATE and DELETE) 
are used to change the data that is already in the database. 
The SQL DELETE command uses a WHERE clause.

1) The UPDATE statement can be written in the following form:
UPDATE table_name 
SET [column_name1= value1,... column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE condition];

UPDATE table_name  
SET column_name = expression  
WHERE conditions  

UPDATE students  
SET User_Name = 'beinghuman'  
WHERE Student_Id = '3'  

2) Updating Multiple Fields:
If you are going to update multiple fields, you should separate each field assignment with a comma.

SQL UPDATE statement for multiple fields:

UPDATE table_name  
SET field1 = new-value1, field2 = new-value2,  
[WHERE CLAUSE]  

SQL UPDATE SELECT:

SQL UPDATE WITH SELECT QUERY:

3) We can use SELECT statement to update records through UPDATE statement.

SYNTAX:

UPDATE tableDestination  
SET tableDestination.col = value  
WHERE EXISTS (  
SELECT col2.value  
FROM  tblSource  
WHERE tblSource.join_col = tblDestination. Join_col  
AND  tblSource.Constraint = value)
