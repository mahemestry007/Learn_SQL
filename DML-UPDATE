- SQL UPDATE -

In a very simple way, we can say that SQL commands(UPDATE and DELETE) 
are used to change the data that is already in the database. 
The SQL DELETE command uses a WHERE clause.

1) The UPDATE statement can be written in the following form:
UPDATE table_name 
SET [column_name1= value1,... column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE condition];

Syntax*
UPDATE table_name  
SET column_name = expression  
WHERE conditions  

e.g.
UPDATE students  
SET User_Name = 'beinghuman'  
WHERE Student_Id = '3';

2) Updating Multiple Fields:
If you are going to update multiple fields, you should separate each field assignment with a comma.

SQL UPDATE statement for multiple fields:

Syntax*
UPDATE table_name  
SET field1 = new-value1, field2 = new-value2,  
[WHERE CLAUSE]  

e.g. 
UPDATE employee  
SET CITY = "MUMBAI", AGE = 30, DESIGNATION = "ADMIN" 
WHERE EMP_ID = 1004;  


3) SQL UPDATE WITH SELECT QUERY:
We can use the SELECT statement to update records through the UPDATE statement.

Syntax*

UPDATE tableDestination  
SET tableDestination.col = value  
WHERE EXISTS (  
SELECT col2.value  
FROM  tblSource  
WHERE tblSource.join_col = tblDestination. Join_col  
AND  tblSource.Constraint = value)  

syntax*

UPDATE Employee AS e
JOIN Hrdata AS h ON e.EmployeeID = h.EmployeeID
SET e.FirstName = 'repomanager',
    e.LastName = 'repomanager',
    h.FirstName = 'repomanager',
    h.LastName = 'repomanager'
WHERE e.EmployeeID BETWEEN 1 AND 7;

e.g


* The SQL EXISTS Operator
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

3) UPDATE STATEMENT USE WHERE AND IN CLAUSE

update table.name
SET column.name = 
WHERE column.name IN (123);

update subquery.employees
set RepoManager = "Don"
Where Employeeid in (2,5,7);
